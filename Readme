Technologies Used = HTML/CSS/JS

Some Assumptions
1. Only one page to be shown.

Challenges I faced
1. Getting the API data was easy.
2. Displaying the data in the form of a table was aslo easy.
3. Sorting the data was a little tricky. As the data was coming from an API and stored using JS. It was not that easy to do. But I succeeded in sorting the names and gender
(able to sort text but not numbers).


Issues yet to solve
1. There is some issue with sorting the number, it reads the first number only, still trying to find another solution.
